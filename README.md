# Huffman-Algorithm
Huffman algorithm for decoding &amp; encoding files using c++

**** NOTE ****
**First Part**
~ the program gets the name of input file fro decodingthe file to zip.txt file which is in a binary format.
~ it also make the huffman.txt file.

**Second Part**
~ for encoding, it opens files zip.txt and huffman.txt automatically and unzip the zip.txt file to restore_input.txt file.

** for making the zip.txt file, i wrote each letter's code and finally added some zeros to the end of the file
   to make the whole file size, a multiplicant of 8.
** in the first of zip.txt file, i wrote the number of zeros added at the end of the file, so that i can ignore the rest of it.
